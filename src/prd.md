# N8N Workshop Registration System - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: A streamlined registration system for n8n workshops that manages invitation links and tracks registration status.

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Managing workshop registrations through a structured invitation link system instead of open registration.
- **User Context**: Workshop organizers need to control access through invitation links, track registration status, and assign links to specific users.
- **Critical Path**: User enters details → System finds open invitation → Assigns invitation to user → Returns registered invitation link
- **Key Moments**: Form submission, invitation assignment, link generation and display

- **Success Criteria**: Links are properly assigned, status updates correctly, and registered links are returned

### Link Assignment System
- **Functionality**: Automatically finds open invitation links and marks them as registered when user submits form
